## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A few years ago I was lucky enough to find [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) YouTube channel and was fantastic. I learned a lot from Daniel. Things about "graphic" computation and algorithms. Inspired by his videos and the desire to practice something new is born this library. A simple library to make graphics.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
